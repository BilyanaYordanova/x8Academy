1) dynamic and array implementations of stack and queue

2) Convert decimal number into binary

3) Towers of Hanoi

4) 1-n not sorted array, find min missing

Examples:
- If array is [3, 2, 5, 10], you must return 1
- If array is [1, 6, 4, 2, 5, 3], you must return 7


5) 1-(n-1) sorted array, find min missing


6) brackets correctness


7) AB3(DC)2(F) - expand to ABDCDCDCFF


8) Array with numbers, return array in which each of the numbers is replaced with the closest number larger than it and right from it (or -1)


Example:
- If array is [3, 2, 5, 10, 4], you must return [5, 5, 10, -1, -1]


9)in numbers array - find 3 corresponding the triangle rule


10) 2 files contain only numbers. Each of the files is too big to be read at once - it must be read line by line or number by number.
In a new file store all the numbers sorted (Solve this task only if you know how to work with files)
